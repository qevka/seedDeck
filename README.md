> This app will help organize seeds for gardeners, so that they can track the performance of different varieties from year to year. This will be a complete organizational system from cataloging to lookups. Plants will be tracked with QR codes and photos that are take of them throughout their life cycle. Meta data about plant growth and fruit quality will be entered and tracked. Hopefully you find this project interesting if you want to contribute or get involved let me know. support@qevka.com.
